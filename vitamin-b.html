        <h2 style="background-color: lightgray;"><strong>Importance of Vitamin-B follows</strong></h2>
        <p> Vitamins naturally occur in food and are needed in very small amounts for various bodily functions such as energy production and making red blood cells. There are 13 vitamins that our body needs, eight of which make up the B-group (or B-complex) vitamins.<br>
            The B-group vitamins do not provide the body with fuel for energy, even though supplement advertisements often claim they do. However, itâ€™s true though that without B-group vitamins the body lacks energy. This is because the B-group vitamins are needed to help the body to use the energy-yielding nutrients (such as carbohydrates, fat and protein) for fuel. Other B-group vitamins are needed to help cells to multiply by making new DNA.</p>
        <p>These vitamins help the process your body uses to get or make energy from the food you eat. They also help form red blood cells. You can get B vitamins from proteins such as fish, poultry, meat, eggs, and dairy products. Leafy green vegetables, beans, and peas also have B vitamins. Many cereals and some breads have added B vitamins.</p>
        <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Types in Vitamin-B</strong></h2>
        <ol class="sai">There are  eight types of vitamin B:
            <li>Thiamin (B1)</li>
            <li>Riboflavin (B2)</li>
            <li>Niacin (B3)</li>
            <li>Pamtothenic acid (B5)</li>
            <li>Pyridoxine (B6)</li>
            <li>Biotin (B7)</li>
            <li>Folic acid (B9)</li>
            <li>Cyanocobalamin (B12)</li>
        </ol>
<h2>Thiamin (B1)</h2>
<p>Thiamin is also known as vitamin B1. It helps to convert glucose into energy and has a role in nerve function.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Good sources of thiamin</strong></h3>
<ul class="sai">
    <li>wholemeal cereal grains</li>
    <li>seeds (especially sesame seeds)</li>
    <li>legumes</li>
    <li>wheatgerm</li>
    <li>nuts</li>
    <li>yeast</li>
    <li>pork. </li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Thiamin deficiency</strong></h3>
<p>Thiamin deficiency is generally found in countries where the dietary staple is white rice. Deficiencies in the Western world are generally caused by excessive alcohol intake and/or a very poor diet. Symptoms include, confusion, irritability, poor arm or leg (or both) coordination, lethargy, fatigue and muscle weakness.</p>
<p>Beriberi is a condition caused by thiamin deficiency and affects the cardiovascular, muscular, gastrointestinal and nervous systems.</p>
<h2>Riboflavin (B2)</h2>
<div>Riboflavin is primarily involved in energy production and helps vision and skin health.</div>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Good sources of riboflavin</h3>
<ul class="sai">
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>yoghurt</li>
    <li>cottage cheese</li>
    <li>wholegrain breads and cereals</li>
    <li>egg white</li>
    <li>leafy green vegetables</li>
    <li>meat</li>
    <li>yeast</li>
    <li>liver </li>
    <li>kidney.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Riboflavin deficiency (ariboflavinosis)</h3>
<p>
Riboflavin deficiency (or ariboflavinosis) is rare and is usually seen along with other B-group vitamin deficiencies. People at risk include those who consume excessive amounts of alcohol and those who do not consume milk or milk products.</p>
<h2>Niacin (B3)</h2>
<div>Niacin is essential for the body to convert carbohydrates, fat and alcohol into energy. It helps maintain skin health and supports the nervous and digestive systems. Unlike other B-group vitamins, niacin is very heat stable and little is lost in cooking.</div>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline ;">Good sources of niacin</h3>
<ul class="sai">
    <li>meats</li>
    <li>fish</li>
    <li>poultry</li>
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>wholegrain breads and cereals</li>
    <li>nuts</li>
    <li>mushrooms</li>
    <li>all protein-containing foods.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Niacin deficiency (pellagra)</h3>
<p>People who drink excessive amounts of alcohol or live on a diet almost exclusively based on corn are most at risk of pellagra. Others causes are associated with digestive problems where the body does not absorb niacin efficiently. </p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Excessive niacin intake</h3>
<p>Large doses of niacin produce a drug-like effect on the nervous system and on blood fats. While favourable changes in blood fats are seen, side effects include, flushing, itching, nausea and potential liver damage.</p>
<h2>Pantothenic acid (B5)</h2>
<p>Pantothenic acid is needed to metabolise carbohydrates, proteins, fats and alcohol as well as produce red blood cells and steroid hormones.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Good sources of pantothenic acid</h3>
<p>Pantothenic acid is widespread and found in a range of foods, but some good sources include liver, meats, milk, kidneys, eggs, yeast, peanuts and legumes.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Pantothenic acid deficiency</h3>
<p>Because pantothenic acid is found in such a wide variety of foods, deficiency is extremely rare.</p>
<h2>Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine)</h2>
<p>Pyridoxine is needed for protein and carbohydrate metabolism, the formation of red blood cells and certain brain chemicals. It influences brain processes and development, immune function and steroid hormone activity.<br />
<br />
</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Good sources of pyridoxine</h3>
<ul class="sai">
    <li>cereal grains</li>
    <li>legumes</li>
    <li>green and leafy vegetables</li>
    <li>fish and shellfish</li>
    <li>meat and poultry</li>
    <li>nuts</li>
    <li>liver</li>
    <li>fruit.<br />
    <br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Pyridoxine deficiency</h3>
<p>Pyridoxine deficiency is rare. People who drink excessive amounts of alcohol, women (especially those on the contraceptive pill), the elderly and people with thyroid disease the most at risk.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Excessive pyridoxine intake</h3>
<p>Pyridoxine toxicity is mostly due to supplementation and can lead to harmful levels in the body that can damage the nerves</p>
<h2>Biotin (B7)</h2>
<p>Biotin (B7) is needed for energy, fat synthesis, amino acid metabolism and glycogen synthesis. High biotin intake can contribute to raised blood cholesterol levels.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Good sources of biotin</h3>
<ul class="sai">
    <li>liver</li>
    <li>cauliflower</li>
    <li>egg yolks</li>
    <li>peanuts</li>
    <li>chicken</li>
    <li>yeast</li>
    <li>mushrooms</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Biotin deficiency</h3>
<p>Biotin deficiency is very rare, it's widely distributed in foods and only required in small amounts. Over-consumption of raw egg whites over periods of several months (by bodybuilders, for example) can induce deficiency because a protein in the egg white inhibits biotin absorption.</p>
<h2>Folate or folic acid (B9)</h2>
<p>Folate, or folic acid (the synthetic form of folate which is used extensively in dietary supplements and food fortification) is needed to form red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body. It helps the development of the foetal nervous system, as well as DNA synthesis and cell growth. Women of child-bearing age need a diet rich in folate for this reason.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Good sources of folate</h3>
<ul class="sai">
    <li>green leafy vegetables</li>
    <li>legumes</li>
    <li>seeds</li>
    <li>liver</li>
    <li>poultry</li>
    <li>eggs</li>
    <li>cereals</li>
    <li>citrus fruits.&nbsp;<br />
    <br />
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Excessive folic acid intake</h2>
<p>
Although folic acid is generally considered non-toxic, excessive intakes above 1,000 mcg per day over a period of time can lead to malaise, irritability and intestinal dysfunction. The main risk with excessive folate intake is that it can mask a vitamin B12 deficiency, so it,s best to consume these two vitamins within the recommended amounts.</p>
<h2>Cyanocobalamin (B12)</h2>
<p>Cyanocobalamin (or vitamin B12) helps to produce and maintain the myelin surrounding nerve cells, mental ability, red blood cell formation and the breaking down of some fatty acids and amino acids to produce energy. Vitamin B12 has a close relationship with folate, as both depend on the other to work properly.</p>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Good sources of B12</h3>
<ul class="sai">
    <li>liver</li>
    <li>meat</li>
    <li>milk</li>
    <li>cheese</li>
    <li>eggs&nbsp;</li>
    <li>almost anything of animal origin.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Vitamin B12 deficiency</h3>
<p>Because vitamin B12 is only found in foods from animal sources, people following strict, as well as breastfed babies of vegan mothers, tend to be most commonly affected.</p>
<p>Absorption of B12 from the gut also tends to decrease with age, so the elderly is another group who are more at risk of deficiency.</p>
